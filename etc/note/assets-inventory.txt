These images evidently expect to be recolored. Alas Egg 1 doesn't have a coloring blit, so all we can do is full tint.
How about Atari-style single-color sprites?

We could compose sprites from these shapes. It's very cheaty but hey, I think anything else we do will be very shit, and composed full-tint sprites might only be mostly shit.
