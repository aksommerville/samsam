Same Same Game Jam, 21 July 2025.

I'm so fucking stumped. What to do?
I swore I wouldn't modify the provided graphics. But these graphics are incomplete and make no sense.

I am going to modify the graphics in at least two ways:
 - Combine all decals in one image.
 - Shuffle positions such that all decals are reachable.
 - Recolor the shotgun's outline. It's crazy to have two different blacks when there's otherwise just two colors total.

heres the deal: you must use only these provided visual assets. 
you have the freedom to modify them however you like, whether that means recoloring them, 
rearranging elements, or using them in new contexts. however, its important that your 
modifications dont drastically change the individual graphics to the point where 
they no longer resemble their original character or composition.

Seems we are well within rights to make those two changes.
